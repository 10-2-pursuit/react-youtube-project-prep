# React YouTube Project Prep 


Welcome to the React YouTube Project! We're excited to see you dive into your first React group project. 
To keep the momentum during the break, we're introducing a prep assignment that will help you stay engaged and prepared for the project. This assignment is meant to ensure you're ready to collaborate effectively and make the most of this experience.  

Keep in mind that group work is not working together as a group on one feature.  Group work means delegating responsibility between team members and meating agreed upon deadlines.  

## Assignment Requirements

Your prep assignment submission should include the following components.  Remember, this work can and should be split amongst team members :

### 1. Trello Board
Create a Trello board that includes all project members (including instructors). Use the board to outline your project plan, tasks, and progress. This will serve as a dynamic tool for task management and collaboration.  


### 2. Delegated Tasks
Assign specific tasks to each team member. Define roles and responsibilities, ensuring everyone has a clear understanding of their contributions. This will foster efficient teamwork and individual accountability. Each task should detail a  User Story that explains a desired feature.  Each member of the team must be assigned at least one user story to work on over the course of the project.


### 3. Component Architecture
Diagram your component architecture. Clearly define how components will interact, including how state and props will flow. This visual representation will help you better understand the structure of your application.

### 4. Wireframes
Develop wireframes for both mobile and desktop views. Consider different screen sizes for tablets, desktops, and phones. This will guide your UI design and ensure a consistent user experience across devices.

### 5. Group Norms
Establish a set of group norms that outline how you'll communicate, make decisions, and handle conflicts. Clear norms will enhance collaboration and create a positive working environment.  This is a contract that you will all agree upon to work together on this project.  It should include

* When we will meet during the break to work 
* How we choose to communicate - Slack? Email?
* Deliverables - what is each team member responsible for delivering over the break?

### 6. GitHub Repository
Create a GitHub repository for your project. Make sure to include all team members as collaborators. This will be your central hub for version control and collaborative coding.  Select one fellow to create and manage this repository.  


## Deliverables

Planning documents for this project are due by ***End of Day 8/27***

### Stand Up

During this stand up each teammember must describe:

# React YouTube Project Prep 


Welcome to the React YouTube Project! We're excited to see you dive into your first React group project. 
To keep the momentum during the break, we're introducing a prep assignment that will help you stay engaged and prepared for the project. This assignment is meant to ensure you're ready to collaborate effectively and make the most of this experience.

## Assignment Requirements

Your prep assignment submission should include the following components:

### 1. Trello Board
Create a Trello board that includes all project members (including instructors). Use the board to outline your project plan, tasks, and progress. This will serve as a dynamic tool for task management and collaboration.



### 2. Delegated Tasks
Assign specific tasks to each team member. Define roles and responsibilities, ensuring everyone has a clear understanding of their contributions. This will foster efficient teamwork and individual accountability.

### 3. Component Architecture
Diagram your component architecture. Clearly define how components will interact, including how state and props will flow. This visual representation will help you better understand the structure of your application.

### 4. Wireframes
Develop wireframes for both mobile and desktop views. Consider different screen sizes for tablets, desktops, and phones. This will guide your UI design and ensure a consistent user experience across devices.

### 5. Group Norms
Establish a set of group norms that outline how you'll communicate, make decisions, and handle conflicts. Clear norms will enhance collaboration and create a positive working environment.  This is a contract that you will all agree upon to work together on this project.

### 6. GitHub Repository
Create a GitHub repository for your project. Make sure to include all team members as collaborators. This will be your central hub for version control and collaborative coding.  Select one fellow to create and manage this repository.  


## Submission

Please submit your prep assignment by End of Day 8/27 through Canvas. This assignment will set the tone for the project and help you make the most of your group effort.
